* Introduction
Orca is an ORg CApture list of recipes; mainly for capturing from a
browser.

The more this package is configured, the less refiling you'll do on
your captures: they will go directly to where they belong.

Here is my example list of configurations:
- Capture URL matching https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs to =emacs.org:Reddit=
- Capture URL matching https://emacs.stackexchange.com/ to =emacs.org:Questions=
- If the current buffer is e.g. =foo.org= and it has a =* Tasks= heading, capture to =foo.org:Tasks=
- If nothing else matches, capture to =ent.org:Articles=.

* Configuration
Just requiring the package, only the "capture to current buffer"
method will work, since no file paths are recognized:
#+begin_src elisp
(require 'orca)
#+end_src

Customize the file paths to your liking using this template:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq orca-handler-list
      '((orca-handler-match-url
         "https://www.reddit.com/emacs/"
         "~/Dropbox/org/wiki/emacs.org"
         "Reddit")
        (orca-handler-match-url
         "https://emacs.stackexchange.com/"
         "~/Dropbox/org/wiki/emacs.org"
         "\\* Questions")
        (orca-handler-current-buffer
         "\\* Tasks")
        (orca-handler-file
         "~/Dropbox/org/ent.org"
         "\\* Articles")))
#+end_src

It's also possible to customize interactively via ~M-x~ =customize-group= ~RET~ =orca= ~RET~.
